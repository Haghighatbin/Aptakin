- **Simulating Charge at Unmeasured Frequencies & Creating a Frequency Map:**  
  We may extend the simulation to a wider range of frequencies (e.g., 6, 60, 120, 360 Hz)-[Computational Resources and Harware Limitation]. In our SWV module, the frequency parameter is a variable in the simulation. By sweeping across a broader frequency range, we may compute the corresponding SWV current profiles. Integrating each current–potential curve (i.e., calculating the area under the curve) gives us the total charge transferred at that frequency (COMSOL project already handled this part, would be fun to code it directly in the Aptakin as well!). Collecting these results creates a “frequency map” that shows how charge (or normalised current) varies with frequency. This map can help identify the optimal frequency range for sensor performance and reveal how the electron transfer kinetics respond to changes in scan frequency (saving months of experimental analysis!).

- **Calculating Packing Density from Charge and Geometry:**  
  The total charge (from integrating the SWV peak) can be related to the number of electrons transferred. Assuming a known electron stoichiometry for the redox reaction of methylene blue (typically one electron per redox event) and knowing Faraday’s constant, we may calculate the number of redox events (and thus the number of immobilised aptamers - Aptamer surface coverage). Given the electrode’s geometry (in our case, 15 mm² as an example), we may then determine the packing density (e.g., molecules per cm² and correlate that to the SOP of aptamer immobilisation). This approach links the electrochemical signal directly to the surface coverage of aptamers.

- **Calculating the “No Response” (Crossover Frequency) Under Saturated Binding:**  
  In a saturated state, all aptamers have changed conformation, so the SWV response should reflect that uniform change. By simulating the SWV response for both the unbound and fully bound conditions, we can compute the crossover frequency—the frequency at which the difference between the two signals (or the normalized response) is minimised. Experimentally, this is seen when the peak responses converge. The current simulation framework already calculates a crossover frequency in the SWV module. Running the simulation with binding parameters set to saturation (fraction bound ≈ 1) allows us to predict this “no response” frequency and use it as a benchmark for sensor behavior under maximal target binding.

- **Additional Valuable Information and Future Directions:**  
  The capabilities of the simulated model can be pushed further to extract more insights:
  - **Sensor Optimisation:** Use the model to optimise parameters (e.g., binding kinetics, aptamer packing density, applied potential) for maximum sensitivity and minimal background noise.
  - **Dynamic Range & Limit of Detection:** Simulate how the sensor responds across a range of target concentrations, thereby determining its dynamic range and limit of detection.
  - **Kinetic Parameter Estimation:** Fit the simulation to experimental data to extract kinetic constants (e.g., kon and koff ) and even the Hill coefficient, which informs about cooperativity.
  - **Electrode Geometry Effects:** Explore how changes in electrode size or shape affect the SWV response and charge transfer characteristics.
  - **Environmental Influences:** Simulate the effect of variables like temperature or ionic strength on both binding kinetics and electron transfer rates using Marcus theory and the Butler–Volmer equation.
  - **Conformational Dynamics:** Model the impact of aptamer conformational changes on electron transfer efficiency. This could include studying time-resolved changes as the sensor responds to varying target concentrations.
  - **Noise and Interference:** Incorporate models of background currents and noise to predict the sensor’s real-world performance.
  - **Predictive Maintenance:** Use the simulation to forecast sensor degradation or fouling over time, potentially enabling recalibration schedules.

In summary, with the algorithms developed, it is not only possible to simulate the sensor’s current response across a range of frequencies but also to extract meaningful physical parameters—such as packing density and binding kinetics—and to predict sensor behavior under different experimental conditions.
